What Is It?
-----------

it is a virtual obesity clinic offering affordable access to FDA-approved weight loss medications like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic. Designed for people with a BMI of 30+ (or 27+ with health conditions), it makes treatment accessible with or without insurance.

Unlike traditional clinics, Mochi offers telehealth consultations, prescription support, and ongoing care through a monthly membershipâ€”all from the comfort of home.
