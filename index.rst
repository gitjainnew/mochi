Ok i got it

What Is It?
-----------

it is a virtual obesity clinic offering affordable access to FDA-approved weight loss medications like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic. Designed for people with a BMI of 30+ (or 27+ with health conditions), it makes treatment accessible with or without insurance.

Unlike traditional clinics, it offers telehealth consultations, prescription support, and ongoing care through a monthly membershipâ€”all from the comfort of home.

How it Works?
----------------------

I's process is fast, simple, and designed for affordability:

#. Start by filling out an online health questionnaire.
#. Get matched with a licensed doctor for virtual evaluation.
#. Receive a prescription for GLP-1 medications if eligible.
#. Choose to fill the prescription through insurance or cash-pay compounding options.
#. Access ongoing support from it's medical team and weight care specialists.

Most users begin treatment within 1-2 weeks, and ongoing check-ins ensure personalized care and progress monitoring.
